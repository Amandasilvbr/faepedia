A very work-in-progress, open-source [Dungeons & Dragons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeons_%26_Dragons) wiki. I wanted a Dungeons & Dragons wiki that was secure, pretty, and free, so I made it! 
- Secure: Hosting on GitHub pages means that the site uses HTTPS, unlike the [DND 5th Edition Community Wiki](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/), which is otherwise very helpful!
- Pretty: I've put a lot of work into the look and feel of Faepedia; let me know what you think about it!
- Free: Completely free and open-source! (Unlike [a certain website I know](https://www.google.com/search?q=d%26d+beyond)...)

Bonus features:
- Accessible: I am dedicated to making Faepedia accessible to the most people I can. If you know a way I can improve accessibility, let me know!
- Modern: Faepedia uses modern ES6 for coding, and all files are made to be readable and understandable.

In summary, I think it's really cool. :)
