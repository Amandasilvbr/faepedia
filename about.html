        <p><b>Faepedia</b> is a very work-in-progress, open-source <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeons_%26_Dragons">Dungeons & Dragons</a> wiki. I wanted a Dungeons & Dragons wiki that was secure, pretty, and free, so I made it!</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Secure: Hosting on GitHub pages means that the site uses HTTPS, unlike the <a href="http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/">DND 5th Edition Community Wiki</a>, which is otherwise very helpful!</li>
            <li>Pretty: I've put a lot of work into the look and feel of Faepedia; let me know what you think about it!</li>
            <li>Free: Completely free and open-source! (Unlike <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=d%26d+beyond">a certain website I know</a>...)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Bonus features:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Accessible: I am dedicated to making Faepedia accessible to the most people I can. If you know a way I can improve accessibility, let me know!</li>
            <li>Modern: Faepedia uses modern ES6 for coding, and all files are made to be readable and understandable.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In summary, I think it's really cool. :)</p>
